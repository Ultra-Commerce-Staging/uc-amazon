## Ultra Commerce Community Module

# Amazon

The uc-amazon module adds support for amazon functionality.   Currently, this includes a an *Amazon S3* 
compatible `FileServiceProvider` implementation. 

The UltraFileService uses providers when working with files that are created by the system.   This includes images and 
other media uploaded through the Ultra Admin as well as files generated by the sytem like the one generated by the 
SiteMap generation process.

A distributed storage (like Amazon S3) is needed when running in a multi-server environment to ensure that images loaded on 
one server are available to the others in the cluster.  Other common alternatives are to use a shared drive via an NFS mount 
and configuring the default FileSystemFileServiceProvider to use that directory.

## Module Configuration
This module is compatible with UltraCommerce 3.1.0-GA.   Version 3.1.1-GA or later is recommended due to a 
performance improvement allowing local caching of images stored on S3.   To use the uc-amazon module requires that you 
have an amazon aws account with s3 capabilities and some basic Ultra Commerce configuration.
